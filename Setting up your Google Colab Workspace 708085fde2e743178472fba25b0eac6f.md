# Setting up your Google Colab Workspace

- Go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- If you haven’t signed up (or signed in) yet, please do so.
- For first time users, you will be redirected in a page that looks like this:

- Click on the `New Notebook` button on the lower left corner of the pop-up window. Upon doing this, a new tab will be opened for you.
- The new page will look like the image below. Notice the `Untitled0.ipynb` written on the upper left corner: this is where you can rename your file. Double click on this to set a name for your project. The release notes sidebar may not be present in your workspace which is fine. Click on the `x` button to close this.

- By this time you should have a renamed project already, that should like the image below. In my case I renamed it as `firstproject.ipynb`.
