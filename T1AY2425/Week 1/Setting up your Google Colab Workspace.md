# Setup

- Go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- If you haven’t signed up (or signed in) yet, please do so.
- For first time users, you will be redirected in a page that looks like this:

- Click on the `New Notebook` button on the lower left corner of the pop-up window. Upon doing this, a new tab will be opened for you.
- The new page will look like the image below. Notice the `Untitled0.ipynb` written on the upper left corner: this is where you can rename your file. Double click on this to set a name for your project. The release notes sidebar may not be present in your workspace which is fine. Click on the `x` button to close this.

- By this time you should have a renamed project already, that should like the image below. In my case I renamed it as `firstproject.ipynb`.

# Add Text & Code Cell

- Initially, your workspace will only contain a code cell, the rectangular, grey box with a play button at the front. A code cell is where python code is inputted, read, and executed.

- There is another type of cell called text cell. We have several methods of adding one. If you have an existing cell like the one above, you can just hover either below or at the top of the existing cell, such that two buttons appear:

    When hovering at the top.
